# Facebook Unsave Bot

This bot repeatedly unsaves saved Facebook posts. With the Python Selenium library and Chrome web driver installed, type in your email and password, run the script and you are good to go! 

##### Note.

1. There are some time.sleep() functions in the code. This is to wait for the page to load/show/unsave posts. Adjust the amount of time depending on your environment.
2. You may have to edit the element classes, if Facebook had changed their page layouts.
